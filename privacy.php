                    <!-- <p>California Do Not Track Disclosures:</p> -->
                    <p>
                        How do we respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to
                        exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online
                        activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
                        
                        We currently do not respond to DNT signals in browsers because we do not track individual users across the web.
                        
                        May other parties collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time
                        and across different websites when they visit <b> domainname.com</b> ?
